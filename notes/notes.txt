-can use "tmux" to run python app in background and while I log off on server

-Now database is displayed out of order on website, since i am adding and deleting on each change
	-might want to reorder when printing out on HTML?

-Fix: why does it keep sending emails about the january 1st?
	-seems to keep deleting it and then readding after 2-3 loops
	-only happens on server, not on my pc...
	-SOLVED: had program running on bootup from rc.local, so it was wiping db and messing it up

-Add to app:
	DONE: dates to reserve if open list
	DONE: func that reserve dates if open

	paste into element to search for in selenium code
