Using "tmux" to run python app in background and while I log off on server

1.1

Now database is displayed out of order on website, since i am adding and deleting on each change
	-might want to reorder when printing out on HTML?

***Fix, why does it keep sending emails about the january 1st?
	-seems to keep deleting it and then readding after 2-3 loops
	-only happens on server, not on my pc...

-Add to app:
	dates to reserve if open list
	func that reserve dates if open

-We can just copy the XPATH from developer tools inspect (right click->copy->xpath) and
	paste into element to search for in selenium code
